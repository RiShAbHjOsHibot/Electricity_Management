## Demand Side Electricity Management with Machine Learinig
- This project is based on optimization of electricity usage in homes.
- We find a pattern in the usage and try some algorithms to better understand the data.
- We treat the signal as a *Time-series* data that gives some unique insights.
- Not very hard to understand but might take some time to understand.
